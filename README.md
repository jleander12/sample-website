Practice using HTML and CSS for front end development

This project focuses predominantly on using flexboxes to position and orient items within the page. Using flexboxes provides flexibility when viewing from different devices or resizing the page since components can grow or shrink and move on the page to acommodate it. Using flex-wrap with items that need a minimum width is a cool trick to make them stack.

At the start of the project too many changes were made without commits and when some confusing behavior showed up and I had to jump back it led to redoing a good chunk of the project. That was a good learning experience and proves the value of git.
